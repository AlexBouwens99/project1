                <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
                    <p>I am a driven Digital Marketing student at Bellevue College, passionate about creative problem-solving and leading impactful projects. My experience spans roles across DECA, the Speech Team, and leadership in Bellevue's Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, where I’ve honed my communication and leadership skills. Whether I’m organizing competitive events or guiding peers through collaborative projects, I thrive in environments that challenge me to think strategically and lead with purpose</p>
                    <p>But in addition to my academic work, I’ve found a real passion for Integrated Marketing Campaigns and SEO, the latter of which inspired me to start freelancing independently. Through projects like Detailed SEO Audits, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience, learning how to analyze & optimize websites and drive results. Now, I’m excited to bring these skills into a collaborative team setting where I can continue to grow, contribute fresh ideas, and make a real impact.</p>
